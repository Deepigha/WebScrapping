# WebScrapping

Throughout this post, we saw how we can use request to access any website from a python code and use BeautifulSoup to extract the HTML content. After extracting the content we formatted it using data frame and later saved the data in CSV file. There was more information that can be retrieved from the website but this post was to find a restaurant, their address, and cuisine. Though the similar process can be used to scrap the data from other websites too.
